# Snake.py
"Snake.py" is a lil python code that I made some months ago as a beginner. I'm releasing it, since I have nothing to upload on GitHub.
To play the game, run the Python file.
To control your snake, use arrow keys. If you hit a border, press ESC, or run over your snake, the game will quit and it'll print your final score.
NOTE: This code may not run on Windows systems. I have tested this on a Linux system. If you are on Windows, make sure to install "windows-curses" via pip. If it still doesn't work, you can try to fix it yourself or don't use it at all lol
